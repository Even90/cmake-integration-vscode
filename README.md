# CMake Integration for Visual Studio Code

The [CMake Integration](https://github.com/go2sh/cmake-integration-vscode) extension provides
a first-class integration of the CMake configure and build workflow into Visual Studio Code.
It lets you mange multiple CMake-based projects in one workspace supported by advanced features like
fine control over projects, targets and configurations, project dependencies, workspace targets and more.
Setup your build environment to through the settings editor and launch your configure and build process from
keyboard or the VSCode command palette.

## Features

The CMake Integration for Visual Studio Code supports:
  * Multiple folders with CMake projects in one workspace
  * VSCode Commands for configuration, build and clean 
    (target-, project- and workspace-based)
  * Project, Target and Configuration selection in the status bar
  * Additional dependency management
  * Custom workspace build targets
  * Diagnostic generated by the compilier

## Requirements

CMake version 3.7 or higher must be installed.

## Quick Start

1. Configure your default Generator in your User Settings (Default is Ninja).
2. Add your CMake project(s) to the workspace.
3. Select your project, target and configuration from the status bar.
4. Hit F7 for building the currently selected target or Shift+F7 for the
   currently selected project (build all).

### Pitfalls

 * Changing the generator of an already generated project requires the CMake
   Client to be restarted and the build directory to be deleted. Simply use the
   command  `Restart CMake Client (Clean)` and select your project.
 * The extension relies on the project name reported by CMake for some 
   advancde operations. Multiple projects with the same name are not supported
   for those.


## Extension Settings

Most settings are documented well through VSCode settings dialog. The most 
important settings are:
 * `cmake.generator`: The generator to generate the build system. Set this to
   an apropriate user default. (See Pitfalls)
 * `cmake.cacheEntries`: Additional CMake cache entries for configuration (like    -D option). The object key specifies the entry name and the value the entry
   value. (e.g. `{ "USE_GTK": "true" } equals "-DUSE_GTK=true")

Options `cmake.workspaceTargets` and `cmake.targetDependencies` can only be
configured on an workspace (window) level. In both cases targets are specified
by either a project name (all targets in the project) or by a project name
and a target name.
```
# Project
{ "project": "test" }
# Project and target
{ "project": "test", "target": "app" }
```
Additionally `cmake.targetDependencies` object take a `dependencies` array for
specifying dependencies for a project or a target.
```
{
    "project": "test",
    "target": "app",
    "dependencies": [
        { "project": "liba" },
        { "project": "libb", "target": "special"}
    ]
}
```
Both options have a JSON schema in place to guide you through the configuration.

## Known Issues

None.

## Roadmap

 * CTest support
 * Compiler (Toolset) and platform selection support
